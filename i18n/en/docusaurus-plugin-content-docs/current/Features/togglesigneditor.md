### Description
* This feature allows you to set signs for decoration with one toggleable command without saving NBT data on your own. 
* You can't use **edit sign** and **toggle edit sign** at the same time. If you toggle writing on signs you can't reedit them.
### Configuration

### Permissions
See [here](/docs/Permissions/#toggle-edit-sign)
### Utilisation
1. You would like to set signs without the sign menu? Write `/toggleeditsign` or `/tes` in your chat and press enter.
2. If you repeat entering the command, the feature is deactivated/activated.
