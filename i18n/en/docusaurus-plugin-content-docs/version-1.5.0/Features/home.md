### Description
* Homes are teleportation points to which builders can teleport back for each world.
* With Volans, it is possible to set homes, delete and to administrate homes of other builders.
### Configuration
Add in the list `features` in the section `volans` the string `"Home"`.
### Permissions
See [here](/docs/Permissions/#home-system)
### Utilisation
1. To set a home, use the command `/sethome` and behind a name of your choice, which only should contain alphanumeric symbols, for example `/sethome test`.
2. If you want to teleport to a home, write `/home` in your chat and the saved name behind, for example `/home test` and press enter.
3. If you want to have an overview of your set homes, put `/homes` into your chat. You can click the blocks in the feedback message to teleport to that specific point. You can also hover to see the matching coordinates.
4. If you want to delete a home, write `/delhome` and the name of your home you want to delete, for example `/delhome test`.
5. To administrate a home of other builders, add the playername to your command, a `:` and the name of the home, for example `/home Seelenretterin:test` to teleport to the home of the player instead.
6. You also can get an overview of the home of other builders with `/homes` and name of `builder`, for example `/homes Seelenretterin`
7. With the same principle deletion of homes of other builders is possible, but this feature should only be used by administration or trustworthy people.
8. Important: At the moment you can set unlimited home points, which are saved to a file with each UUID.
