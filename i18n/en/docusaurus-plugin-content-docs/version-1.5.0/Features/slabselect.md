### Description
* With the Slab Select feature you can break two slabs on top of one another individually without breaking both. This is useful to set thin branches on trees or to change decoration.
### Configuration
Add in the list `features` in the section `volans` the string `"SlabSelect"`.
### Permissions
See [here](/docs/Permissions/#slab-select)
### Utilisation
1. Set a slab of your choice and on top of it another one, so that both are counting as one block.
2. Now break the slab you want to remove.
3. It should be only one slab left which you didn't look at.
